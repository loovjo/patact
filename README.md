patact is a simple algebra solver that self-learns by at first applying random steps to each side and then checking what worked and didn't and learns based of that.

## Current state:

Currently, patact contains the following:

* A way to represent expressions and equations
* Simple reduction of expressions (with simple factornig)
* Patterns for expressions and equations
* Simple actions based on those patterns
